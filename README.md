# DNN-tf.learn

I added one line to random_data_generator.py to add a row at the beginning of the random data containing the amount of data generated and the amount of features of the data. 
You need to create two data sets, test_data1.csv and test_data2.csv, using random_data_generator1.py to feed into tflearn_test.py.

tflearn_test.py is adapted from the TensorFlow tutorial here: https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/tflearn
